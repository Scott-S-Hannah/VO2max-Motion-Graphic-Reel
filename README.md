# What is VO₂max? A motion graphic reel

A 59-second vertical (1080×1920, 30 fps) Instagram reel explaining VO₂max. It opens with A.V. Hill and the 1923 Douglas-bag experiments and ends in a modern sports-science lab at Winchester. It is built on the **University of Winchester design system** in Claude Design: tokens, bespoke motifs, logo and Asset Bank photography, with Figtree throughout.

**Output:** `out/vo2max_reel.mp4` (H.264 + AAC, faststart; `out/vo2max_reel_preview.mp4` is a smaller copy for messaging), with a cover frame at `out/cover.png`.

## Storyboard

| Time | Scene | Look | Key content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–3.8 s | **The origin story** | Sepia newsreel: grain, gate weave, scratches, sprockets | A.V. Hill (1886–1977), Nobel Prize 1922; a “1923 · Hill & Lupton” stamp |
| 3.8–8 s | **Measuring every breath** | Archival illustration | A runner with a Douglas bag, mouthpiece and nose clip; expired air is analysed for O₂ and CO₂ |
| 8–14.5 s | **What the bags revealed** | Hand-inked graph on graph paper | O₂ uptake rises with speed and then plateaus. Hill measured ≈ 4 L·min⁻¹ for himself, and the authors named it the “maximum oxygen intake”. A film burn then cuts to colour |
| 14.5–21 s | **01 The name** | Deep Purple, kinetic type, CopyFrame | V̇ = volume per minute, O₂ = oxygen, max = maximum, followed by the definition |
| 21–31 s | **02 The oxygen journey** | Light theme, Key-icon tiles, pill chips | Lungs → heart → muscle mitochondria, then the Fick principle: V̇O₂max = HR × SV × a–v̄O₂ diff. Cardiac output is usually the main limit |
| 31–38.5 s | **03 The numbers** | Deep Purple; chart on a white panel | mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹; typical ranges from inactive adults up to the highest values reported |
| 38.5–47 s | **04 The modern test** | Asset Bank photo of the Winchester lab; live chart | Incremental treadmill test with breath-by-breath V̇O₂. Covers the plateau, RER ≥ 1.10, HR near max, and when to call it V̇O₂peak instead |
| 47–54 s | **05 Why it matters** | CopyFrame, KeyStatistic tile, Bright Green panel | Performance; 13% lower all-cause mortality per 1-MET increase; trainability varies between people |
| 54–59 s | **Outro** | Deep Purple | Quatrefoil PhotoFrame, “your aerobic ceiling”, a 1923 → today timeline, the white banner logo and the MotifStrip |

Every scene cut lands on a beat of the 120 bpm soundtrack. The archival piano plays the same Am–F–C–G progression that the modern track later picks up.

The value bars (≈35, ≈50, 70–85+, ≈96 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) are approximate illustrative ranges, and the reel labels them that way on screen.

## Brand

Source: the **University of Winchester** design system in Claude Design (built from *Corporate Brand Guidelines: the essentials*, V1, April 2026).

| Token | Hex | How the reel uses it |
|---|---|---|
| Deep Purple `deep-purple` | `#291647` | Dark-theme ground; text on the light theme |
| Bright Purple `bright-purple` | `#C68EFD` | Labels and accents on Deep Purple; CopyFrame panels; large italic emphasis on white |
| Bright Green `bright-green` | `#D4EF70` | Titles on Deep Purple, key figures, panels, the PhotoFrame shadow |
| `deep-purple-90` / `light-grey` | `#3E2D5A` / `#E6EBEB` | Motif background patterns (tints only) |
| Deep Grey | `#706E6C` | Chart captions on white |

The reel follows these brand rules:

- It uses only the approved text pairings, and never puts Bright Purple or Bright Green text on white.
- Charts sit on white panels.
- Motifs are single-colour and used as patterns, a CopyFrame, a quatrefoil PhotoFrame and a closing MotifStrip.
- The white logo sits on Deep Purple with clear space and no strapline beside it.
- Bullets and arrows are solid triangles, and there is no emoji.

The motif paths, logo and photos (`reel/assets/`: Asset Bank images UoW_Sport_1218 and UoW_Sport_1232) come from that design system. The brand's headline face is Ivy Presto Display (Playfair Display as a stand-in). This reel uses **Figtree** throughout, as requested.

## Adding a real archival photo

Put a public-domain portrait of A.V. Hill at `reel/assets/av-hill.jpg`, for example the 1922 Nobel portrait from Wikimedia Commons. The oval frame then uses the photo, with a sepia treatment, in place of the silhouette. After that, re-render the reel.

## Rebuild

```bash
pip install numpy scipy imageio-ffmpeg        # soundtrack synth + ffmpeg binary
npm i -g playwright                           # or use an existing install
python3 audio.py                              # -> out/soundtrack.wav
NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g) FFMPEG=$(python3 -c "import imageio_ffmpeg;print(imageio_ffmpeg.get_ffmpeg_exe())") \
  node render.cjs video 4                     # -> out/vo2max_reel.mp4
node render.cjs stills 5 17 27                # single frames for review
```

To preview in a browser in real time, serve the folder (for example `npx serve reel`) and open `index.html?preview`. Photos need http rather than `file://`.

The soundtrack is fully synthesised in code, so it contains no samples or licensed music.
